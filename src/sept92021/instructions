Create a function that takes the memory size (ms is a string type) as an argument and returns the actual memory size.

Examples
actualMemorySize("32GB") --> "29.76GB"

actualMemorySize("2GB") --> "1.86GB"

actualMemorySize("512MB") --> "476MB"

Notes
-The actual storage loss on a USB device is 7% of the overall memory size!
-If the actual memory size was greater than 1 GB, round your result to two decimal places.
-If the memory size after adjustment is smaller then 1 GB, return the result in MB.
